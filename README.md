# ProjectManager
A customizable schedule app that automatically assign task to your daily calendar in order for you to follow and finish your projects prior to due dates.

## Objectives
To build a calendar app that adheres to college students. It can automatically load in student schedule form icalendar (.ics), google calendar, from their university website schedule and their canvas schedule. It will ask the student what blocks of time will they use to study and how long will each assignment take, and the calendar can dymanically allocate each assignment from canvas into those homework periods, telling the student to work on this assignment at what time, and allocate these tasks evenly especially when a big project or a long paper due 2 months away but you need to work on it 5 hours a week. Then by the end of each day the calendar asks the student to evaulate their productivity in each task, to draw a analytical conclusion of their own productivity weekly so the student can learn about their own productivity.
